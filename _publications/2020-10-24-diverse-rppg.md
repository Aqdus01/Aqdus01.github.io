<i>The proposed method uses small variations in skin color, as well as novel physics guided techniques to estimate the heart rate in a skin tone robust manner. 
The plots show low pass filtered versions (containing the first and second harmonics of the estimated pulse rate) of both the ground truth and estimated pulse 
waveforms to visualize the similarity.</i>

## Abstract
Heart rate (HR) is an essential clinical measure for the assessment of cardiorespiratory instability. Since communities of color are disproportionately affected by 
both COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease, there is a pressing need to deploy contactless HR sensing solutions for high-quality telemedicine evaluations. Existing
computer vision methods that estimate HR from facial videos exhibit biased performance against dark skin tones. We present a novel physics-driven algorithm that 
boosts performance on darker skin tones in our reported data. We assess the performance of our method through the creation of the first telemedicine-focused remote 
vital signs dataset, the VITAL dataset. 432 videos (~864 minutes) of 54 subjects with diverse skin tones are recorded under realistic scene conditions with 
corresponding vital sign data. Our method reduces errors due to lighting changes, shadows, and specular highlights and imparts unbiased performance gains across 
skin tones, setting the stage for making medically inclusive non-contact HR sensing technologies a viable reality for patients of all skin tones.
