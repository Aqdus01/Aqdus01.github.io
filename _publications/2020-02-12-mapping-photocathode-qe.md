## Abstract
Measuring the quantum efficiency (QE) map of a photocathode injector typically requires laser scanning, an invasive operation that involves 
modifying the injector laser focus and rastering the focused laser spot across the photocathode surface. Raster scanning interrupts normal 
operation and takes considerable time to setup. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel method of measuring the QE map using a ghost imaging 
framework that correlates the injector laser spatial variation over time with the total charge yield. Ghost imaging enables passive, real-time
monitoring of the QE map without manually modifying the injector laser or interrupting injector operation. We first demonstrate the method at 
the UCLA Pegasus photoinjector with the help of a digital micromirror device (DMD) and a piezoelectric mirror to increase our control of the 
overall transverse variance of the illumination profile. The reconstruction algorithm parameters are fine-tuned using simulations and the results
are validated against the ground truth map acquired using the traditional rastering method. Finally, we apply the technique to data acquired 
parasitically from the LCLS photoinjector, showing the feasibility of this method to retrieve a QE map without interrupting normal operation.
