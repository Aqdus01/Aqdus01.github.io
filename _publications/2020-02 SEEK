<i>Schematics of the ghost imaging experiment. An ultrashort 266 nm laser pulse illuminates the DMD and is then imaged onto the cathode. 
The generated electron beam is imaged using the gun solenoid onto a target located 2.7 m downstream. A single pixel bucket detector records 
the intensity of the transmitted beam after the target. The reduced intensity in the center of the electron profile is due to the cathode's 
nonuniform quantum efficiency.</i>

## Abstract
In this Letter we report a demonstration of electron ghost imaging. A digital micromirror device directly modulates the photocathode drive laser to 
control the transverse distribution of a relativistic electron beam incident on a sample. Correlating the structured illumination pattern to the total 
sample transmission then retrieves the target image, avoiding the need for a pixelated detector. In our example, we use a compressed sensing framework to improve 
the reconstruction quality and reduce the number of shots compared to raster scanning a small beam across the target. Compressed electron ghost imaging can reduce both 
acquisition time and sample damage in experiments for which spatially resolved detectors are unavailable (e.g., spectroscopy) or in which the experimental architecture
precludes full frame direct imaging.
