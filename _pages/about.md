I recently completed my Master's Degree in Electronics and Information from [Engineering from Jeonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea,JBNU](https://www.jbnu.ac.kr/kor/) with research focused on Fundamental Deep Learning and Compuer Vision Applications to Healthcare and Precision Agriculture.
My primary research mission is to solve various vision problems like Segmentation, Detection, Depth Estimation, and Classification. Moreover, I also investigates topics related to Deep learning on Mobile Devices, BioInformatics, Optical Flow and Signal Processing.
My research work is funded by National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and Agricultural Science and Technology Development Cooperation of Korea.

I obtained my B.S. in Physics with Cum Laude in 2019 from the [Department of Physics & Astronomy, UCLA](https://www.pa.ucla.edu/). During this time, I 
conducted research under the supervision of [Prof. Pietro Musumeci](https://www.pa.ucla.edu/faculty-websites/musumeci.html). My focus was on investigating laser shaping tools for ultrafast electron photoinjectors. Check out our world's first demonstration of electron ghost imaging [here](/publication/2018-09-11-electron-ghost-imaging). 

Beyond research and academia, I enjoy soccer (Chelsea F.C. fan), bouldering, video games, reading, and listening to music and podcasts. I also have a passion to teach and to share knowledge. I am 
currently planning on starting a podcast in 2021 interviewing graduate students and their experiences. Please [email me](mailto:krish@kabra.com) if you're interested in sharing your story!

### Site Credits
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. 
[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating
when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, 
and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork 
[this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your
own site for free, with no ads!
