Recently, I completed my Master's Degree in Electronics and Information Engineering from [Jeonbuk National University (JBNU), Jeonju, Republic of Korea,](https://www.jbnu.ac.kr/kor/) (2019-2021) with research focused on Fundamental Deep Learning and Compuer Vision Applications to Healthcare and Precision Agriculture.

I obtained my B.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with <b> Magna Cum Laude </b> from [Bahria University Islamabad, (BUIC) Pakistan](https://www.bahria.edu.pk/) (2014-2018). 

## Research Interests
My primary research mission is to solve vision based problems like Segmentation, Detection, Depth Estimation, and Classification. 
Moreover, I also investigate topics related to Deep learning on Mobile Devices, Bioinformatics, Optical Flow and Signal Processing.


## Honors and Awards

During this period I won the following Awards, Scholarships and Internships.
