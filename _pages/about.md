I recently completed my Master's Degree in Electronics and Information Engineering from [Jeonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea, (JBNU)](https://www.jbnu.ac.kr/kor/) with research focused on Fundamental Deep Learning and Compuer Vision Applications to Healthcare and Precision Agriculture.
My primary research mission is to solve various vision problems like Segmentation, Detection, Depth Estimation, and Classification. 

Moreover, I also investigates topics related to Deep learning on Mobile Devices, BioInformatics, Optical Flow and Signal Processing.

I obtained my B.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with <b> Magna Cum Laude </b> from [Bahria University Islamabad, Pakistan](https://www.bahria.edu.pk/)(2014-2018 batch). 

During this period I won the following Internships and Scholarships Awards.
[CERN, Switzerland "Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire" Summer Program (2018] (https://home.cern/summer-student-programme)
[Türkiye Belediyeler Birliği – Çankaya/Ankara, Turkey, LocalInternational Internship Program](https://www.cankaya.bel.tr/pages/129/Turkiye-Belediyeler-Birligi--Union-of-Municipalities-of-Turkey-TBB/)
[National Institute of Electronics – Islamabad, Pakistan, Internee](http://www.nie.gov.pk/)
## Funding
My research work is funded by National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and Agricultural Science and Technology Development Cooperation of Korea.

### Site Credits
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. 
[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating
when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, 
and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork 
[this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your
own site for free, with no ads!
