I recently completed my Master's Degree in Electronics and Information Engineering from [Jeonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea, (JBNU)](https://www.jbnu.ac.kr/kor/) with research focused on Fundamental Deep Learning and Compuer Vision Applications to Healthcare and Precision Agriculture.
My primary research mission is to solve various vision problems like Segmentation, Detection, Depth Estimation, and Classification. 

Moreover, I also investigate topics related to Deep learning on Mobile Devices, BioInformatics, Optical Flow and Signal Processing.

I obtained my B.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with <b> Magna Cum Laude </b> from [Bahria University Islamabad, (BUIC) Pakistan](https://www.bahria.edu.pk/) (2014-2018 batch). 

During this period I won the following Scholarships and Internships Awards.

[Brain Korea (BK21) Scholarship](https://int.korea.edu/kuis/grad/bk21.do)

[Bahria University Advanced Merit Scholarship](https://www.bahria.edu.pk/buic/ees/scholarships/)

[CERN, Switzerland "Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire" Summer Program (2018](https://home.cern/summer-student-programme)

[Türkiye Belediyeler Birliği – Çankaya/Ankara, Turkey, LocalInternational Internship Program](https://www.cankaya.bel.tr/pages/129/Turkiye-Belediyeler-Birligi--Union-of-Municipalities-of-Turkey-TBB/)

[National Institute of Electronics – Islamabad, Pakistan, Internee](http://www.nie.gov.pk/)




## Funding
My research work is funded by National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and Agricultural Science and Technology Development Cooperation of Korea.
