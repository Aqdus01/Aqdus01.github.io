## Abstract 
This IoS application classifies singing vs speaking vs silence of the last 2 seconds based on 
microphone sensor data. It utilizes a deep learning based CNN model.

A more advanced version of this project is in progress, where the aim is to use Mobile Deep Learning for Plant/ Weed Recognition and their diseases in the remote areas.
