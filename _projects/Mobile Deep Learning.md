## Abstract 
This IoS application classifies singing vs speaking vs silence of the last 2 seconds based on 
microphone sensor data. It utilizes a deep learning based CNN model.

In case you accept this challenge, provide us with a small set of slides describing your approach, the commented source code and a compiled .apk supporting Android 6.0+.
